# SoftwareDevelopmentLifeCycles

  In order to interpret user needs and turn them into working software, I first need to sit
down with the client and discuss the details and direction of the project. I would then begin by
dissecting their vision and translating it into functions and code that will need to be written for
the project. User stories assist with this by breaking down the client's needs into very small
chunks of code to be written by the developers. Each story represents a certain operation the
software must perform, and must be running efficiently and effectively before it is integrated
with the rest of the software.
  When working on developing programs, I find staying organized and fixated on smaller
portions of projects at a time works best for me. During this term, I have loved learning about the
Agile methodology, as it seems like a great way for an entire team to continue learning and
networking with each other. It is also refreshing to hear mistakes being acknowledged as the
greatest way of learning for yourself. I have always felt that way and hope to incorporate that
more in my professional and personal life. I also think the multitude of visual tools used to keep
track of progress in an Agile environment, will be great resources for me in the future.
  There are several traits that I think help determine whether someone is a good team
member or not. You should be someone who is present mentally when working with your team,
and you should be able to stay focused and on task. I also think you need to be reliable and feel
that you have a purpose where you work, and with the people you work with. I think in order to
be a good team member, itâ€™s also extremely important to be someone who constantly desires new
knowledge and runs from being stagnant in work and life. I think being personable and sincere
with your team members is very important also.
